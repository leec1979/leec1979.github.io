## Key Achievements
* Worked with the engineering organisation to identify and remove dependencies on a rate-limiting service that had become a single point of failure for the software ecosystem, improving Cash App uptime.
* Led the development of internal localisation services and developer tooling, enabling Cash App back-end and front-end systems to supply user-facing content  in multiple languages.
* Led the migration of the Splice subscription management system legacy codebase into microservices. This resulted in improved scalability and resiliency while providing a solid foundation for adding new features.
* Led the development of new “dynamic loan terms” functionality in Square Capital, which was required for Square Capital to provide loans as part of the US government's Paycheck Protection Program response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Work Experience

### Software Engineer@Cash App (Block Inc.) 11/2021 - 01/2024
* Worked with the engineering organisation to identify and reduce reliance on a single point of failure internal rate-limiting system, which had contributed to multiple outages. We reduced traffic to the rate-limiter by over 50%, improving the resilience and reliability of Cash App services.
* Led the design and development of backend services to automate the translation of Cash App content from US English to other languages via a third party translation management system. This enabled Cash App to support multiple locales, a first step for launching in other regions.
* Developed a library that generates pseudo-translated content used to verify that a system looks and behaves correctly with non-US English content. This accelerated the localisation process by eliminating the need for real translations during software and design readiness testing.
* Mentored junior engineers across the engineering organisation. Mentoring subjects included technical, behavioural and career development.

### Senior Software Engineer@Cedar 07/2021 - 10/2021
* Integrated Sage Maker into Cedar's A/B testing infrastructure, enabling data engineers to use complex machine learning models to support decision making. This integration enabled more targeted decisions about which payment plans to offer patients, improving the patient experience and increasing provider payments.

### Senior Software Engineer@Splice 09/2020 - 07/2021
* Built the first generation of a subscription management service in the Splice ecosystem. Functionality was transferred from a monolithic system with no negative impact on users, providing a resilient, scalable base from which to expand subscription management functionality.
* Improved the trial subscription conversion process to provide immediate payment processing feedback, which previously took up to 1 hour. This improved the customer sign-up experience while increasing fraud resilience.

### Software Engineer@Square (Block Inc.) 02/2018 - 09/2020
* Led a project adding the ability to dynamically modify and recalculate Square Capital's loan terms for an active loan. This new capability was a requirement for Square Capital to offer Pay Check Protection Program loans as part of the US government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
* Designed and developed an integration between Square's customer support system and the Square Developer APIs enabling Square Capital customers to make one-time loan repayments using a debit card. This was one of the most customer requested features and gave Square Capital customers more flexibility and autonomy in managing their loans.

### Software Engineer@Intel (via acquisition) 12/2015 - 02/2018
* Designed and developed Python libraries to interact with integrated circuit design and data management tools. These libraries were the foundation upon which other build, verification and release tools were built.

### Member of Technical Staff@Altera 10/2013 - 12/2015
* Designed and built a synchronisation tool that provided scalable, reliable synchronisation of internal software builds across all global engineering locations with minimal impact on WAN performance. Average daily build output was ~1.5TB and synchronised to 5 locations around the globe.

### Software Engineer@3M (via acquisition of Federal Signal Technologies) 04/2012 - 09/2013
* Designed and developed tools to aid field support engineers configure and maintain road-side systems
  in automated road tolling sites.

### Senior Software Engineer@Altera 09/2008 - 04/2012
* Designed and developed an automated build synchronization system to ensure internal builds were
distributed to all global engineering locations while minimizing WAN impact.
* Developed automated reporting and maintenance systems for Altera's in-house compute farm system.

### Project Manager@McAfee 09/2007 - 09/2008
* Managed project teams and stakeholders to ensure projects were delivered to schedule and budget.

### Software Engineer@Imperas 07/2005 - 09/2007
* Designed and developed a distributed regression test system. This system improved regression test
  turnaround time from days to hours.

### Software Engineer@3Com 01/2001 - 04/2005
* Designed and developed a standardized build system for use with all Linux based 3Com platforms. This
  provided a common build flow that produced firmware images for all hardware platforms and
  architectures.

### Software Engineer@Bull Information Systems 09/1997 - 01/2001
* Designed and built bespoke Windows based software to meet customer requirements.
